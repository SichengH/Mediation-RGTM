abstract: 
  Old: 
  -LDLC as mediator, run mediation analysis with survival outcome
  -Interaction effect, hard to explain
  -Assumption is coming from selection and RTM
  
  New:
  1. Add RTM adjustment to simulation(method from paper)
  2.

# Chapter One: Background

# Chapter Two: Current Method

## 2.1 Causal Mediation Analysis

Given gY is a link function for estimator.

Total Effect (TE)

$$TE = gY(E[Y_{a = 1} | C = c] - E[Y_{a = 0} | C = c] )$$

Total Natural Indirect Effect (TNIE), where interaction effect are credit to indirect effect.


$$TNIE = gY(E[Y_{a = 1,M_a = 1} | C = c] - E[Y_{a = 1,M_a = 0} | C = c] )$$

Pure Natural Direct Effect (PNDE), difference between TE and TNIE.

$$PNDE = gY(E[Y_{a = 1,M_a = 0} | C = c] - E[Y_{a = 0,M_a = 0} | C = c] )$$

## 2.2 Assumptions of causal mediation analysis

### 2.2.1 Causal Consistency

### 2.2.2 Positivity

### 2.2.3 Ignorability 

## 2.3 Result of causal mediation analysis (prelimnary results)



## 2.4 Conclusion from prelimnary results

1. Direct effect exist, indicate there is additional pathway\n
2. Interaction effect is significant, indicate there is possible difference in mechanism\n
3. Relationship between risk and post-randomization LDLC in the control group behaves counter intuitively\n

# Chapter Three: 

## 3.1 Possible reasons for prelimnary results / Problem of using current method

### 3.1.1 Multiple Mediator

Multiple mediator could explain the large direct effect, but from single mediator analysis, except APOB we don't have any candidate for second mediator, and APOB and LDLC belong to the same pathway. \n


### 3.1.2 RTM / unstable LDLC

1. Observe that LDLC measure is unstable.\n

2. Experiment has selected people with LDLC under 130(unit)\n

Combining, measurement are subject to regression toward the mean. \n

### 3.1.3 Heterogeneity


## 3.2 Simulation

### 3.2.1 Simulation Framework

#### 3.2.1.1 Exposure and outcome

Random assigned exposure in 50:50 ratio. Using survival outcome.

#### 3.2.1.2 Mediator and mediating effect

Mediator simulation:

Populations mean
$$LDLCmean \sim N(m_0,sd_0) $$

Individual mean in a short period / cumulative LDLC

$$LDLCmean^* \sim LDLCmean + N(0,sd^*) $$
Individual Measurement

$$LDLCmeasured_i \sim LDLCmean_i + N(0,sd_i)$$

How to simulate risk.

1. Use measurement\n

Whatever the measurements are, whatever the risk is. Problem is risk vary quite a lot.Not possible to make mistake in this case. And it is not what we expected in the real data.  

2. Use mean\n positivist problem, data has no one's LDLC dropped naurally. 

3. Use something in between, short term mean.\n



#### 3.2.1.3 Parameter

1. Assume no direct effect, no interaction term.\n
2. Using survival outcome\n
